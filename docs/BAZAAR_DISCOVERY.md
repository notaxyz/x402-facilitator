# Bazaar discovery: architecture

How the facilitator's [`bazaar` extension](https://docs.x402.org/extensions/bazaar) fits together with a
resource server that sells through it. The seller shown is
[notaxyz/bazaar-seller](https://github.com/notaxyz/bazaar-seller), an Arbitrum One contract-analysis API;
any x402 resource server that declares the extension works the same way.

- **Buyer / agent**: any x402 client. Uses `withBazaar(new HTTPFacilitatorClient(...))` from `@x402/extensions`
  to read the catalog and `wrapFetchWithPayment` from `@x402/fetch` to pay.
- **Seller**: an `@x402/express` resource server. Declares how its paid route is called with
  `declareDiscoveryExtension`; the declaration rides along in every 402 it returns.
- **Facilitator**: this repository. `/verify` and `/settle` validate the declaration echoed in the payment payload
  (`src/bazaar.ts`), the settle hook indexes it once the payer's transfer has confirmed (`src/settle.ts`),
  and `GET /discovery/resources` serves the catalog (`src/discoveryStore.ts`, migration
  `006_discovery_resources.sql`).
- **Chains**: payments settle in USDC on the network the facilitator is configured for (Arbitrum Sepolia in
  development). The data the seller sells comes from Arbitrum One and never touches the payment path.

```

1. The agent lists the catalog. Each item carries the resource URL, the price terms (`accepts`), and the seller's
   declaration (`extensions.bazaar.info`): method, example query parameters, output example.
2. The agent calls the route and receives a 402 whose `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header repeats the declaration.
3. The client SDK signs an EIP-3009 authorization and echoes the declaration into `PaymentPayload.extensions`.
   This echo is how the declaration reaches the facilitator: the seller forwards the whole payload to `/verify`.
4. `/verify` validates the declaration (spec invariants, `info` against its own JSON Schema, absolute resource URL,
   well-formed `accepts`) and reports the outcome to the seller in the `EXTENSION-RESPONSES` header
   (`processing` or `rejected` with a reason). Payment verification is unaffected by the outcome.
5. The seller does the work and answers the buyer.
6. `/settle` submits `transferWithAuthorization`, waits for the receipt and the expected `Transfer` event, and only
   then upserts `discovery_resources`. The header reports `success`. A declaration attached to a payment that never
   lands is never indexed.

## What the catalog does and does not attest

A catalog row records that **a declaration accompanied a payment that confirmed onchain to the facilitator, settled
under the API key of the merchant stored in `merchant_address`.** That is all it records.

It does **not** attest that the declaring party controls the resource URL. The declaration and `resource.url` arrive
in the buyer's `PaymentPayload`, which the buyer signs and can edit. A buyer can settle a genuine payment to a genuine
merchant while declaring any URL and any metadata; the facilitator has no way to prove domain ownership and does not
try to. Consumers should treat entries as leads that cost someone real USDC to place, not as verified listings.

Two rules limit the damage:

- **First writer owns the key.** The merchant whose payment first indexed a `(resource, toolName)` pair owns the row.
  Later settlements by any other merchant for the same key are ignored and reported back as
  `rejected` / `resource claimed by another merchant`, so one cheap payment cannot rewrite another merchant's price,
  `payTo` or metadata.
- **`accepts` is a union.** Each settlement carries the single requirement the buyer chose, so a row accumulates the
  distinct requirements seen across confirmed settlements (deduplicated by jsonb containment). A seller accepting
  several networks appears with all of them once each has been paid at least once. Filtering by `network`, `scheme`
  or `payTo` matches any entry in the set.

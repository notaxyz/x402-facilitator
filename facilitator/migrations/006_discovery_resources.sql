-- Migration 006: Bazaar discovery index
-- Resources advertised through the x402 `bazaar` extension. A row is written only
-- when a payment carrying the declaration has confirmed onchain (see settle.ts), so
-- nothing appears in GET /discovery/resources unless it has actually been paid for.
--
-- Trust boundary: the declaration and resource URL come from the paying client's
-- payload. A row records that a declaration accompanied a confirmed payment to the
-- merchant in merchant_address; it does not attest that anyone controls the URL.
-- The first merchant to index a (resource_url, tool_name) owns the row: later
-- settlements by other merchants for the same key are rejected, never merged.

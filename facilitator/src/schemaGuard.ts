/**
 * Guarded JSON Schema validation for bazaar declarations.
 *
 * `validateDiscoveryExtension` compiles the declaration's own `schema` with Ajv and runs
 * it against the declaration's own `info`. Both halves come from the paying client, and
 * Ajv turns a schema `pattern` straight into a `RegExp` with no linear-time guarantee and
 * no timeout, so a schema like `{"pattern": "^(a+)+$"}` matched against `"aaaa...b"` costs
 * exponential time in the length of the data. On the main thread that blocks the event
 * loop for the whole process: one request, one outage.
 *
 * So the Ajv step runs in a worker thread we can actually kill. A validation that outruns
 * DISCOVERY_SCHEMA_TIMEOUT_MS gets its worker terminated and reports `timedOut`; the
 * caller treats that as a rejected declaration. Catastrophic backtracking and an
 * expensive compile are both covered, without having to guess which regexes are unsafe.
 *
 * One worker serves every request, because a worker busy backtracking cannot serve
 * anything else anyway. Jobs queue; past MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH they report `unavailable`, which
 * the caller reports as `processing` rather than as a verdict on the declaration.
